Create README

f you would like to follow a standard template, then have the main repo's readme.md file give the overview. 

It should briefly describes yourself, then organizes the page into short sections for projects. 

Use proper formatting syntax Links to an external site.. 

Each section has a short description of that project's purpose, code, and work you contributed. Also each section has animated gifs showing the project in action. 

Each section also links to the GitHub project's folder that contains the code for that project. 

With this readme.md in place, a potential employer could simply visit your page, then the readme.md would render, and the person can scroll down and quickly see code in action and could click on the code to see more. (The employer could also still git clone the entire repository to view it locally.)
